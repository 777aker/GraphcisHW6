hw6: Textures

Kelley Kelley
CSCI 5229 Fall 2021

This is basically HW5, but now
there are textureessss
Wait, cool property of modular textures,
if intensity is super high when it's "dark"
the texture just goes over the color, but
when it's "light" it becomes the texture,
so obviously I put intensity at .5 to start cause
it looks cool

Time Spent: 9 hrs
(2 of which were just finding and resizing textures)

Key Bindings: (they're getting pretty lengthy)
Space: rerandomize everything

light controls:
-/+: change light height
</>: change light intensity
0: stop light

display controls:
Arrow keys: move display around
